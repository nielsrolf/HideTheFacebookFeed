# Hide the Facebook Newsfeed
What information to consume is an important question. In my opinion, the facebook newsfeed has no value and distracts too often, so I don't want to see it anymore. Since I still need Facebook for messages and events, I'm just quitting the feed.

# Install
Download this repository [here](https://github.com/nielsrolf/HideTheFacebookFeed/archive/master.zip) and unpack it. Then visit `chrome://extensions/`, enable developer mode (top right), click `Load Unpacked` and select the folder you just created.
